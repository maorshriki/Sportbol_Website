    To run my project:

        1. install node 
        2. from root directory (Sportball) run the command - npm install
        3. from client directory (Sportball/client) run the command - npm install
        4. run - npm run data:import (this will load all the data into the data
        base) 
        5. run - npm run dev (in order to run the app)
        6. For security reasons, in order to enter the admin user, 
        enter the database and edit the field (role = admin) in the user object,
        as attached in the following image.
        In order to enter the database (mongodb atlas),
        enter the following details:
        Username - maor92272@gmail.com Password -

        Attached a picture of the steps that must be performed after logging in:
        Maor (top right corner) -> cloud -> Browse Collections ->
        users -> double click on the role field of the account you
        registered
